RevoR Clustering
================

Using RevoScaleR functions I was able to do customer segmentation on a large customer dataset which came from the Kaggle Datamining challenge.  
The code included shows cluster diagnostics, scripting functions, usage of the xdf file format, and outlier handling.
The code was then visualized and shown via a Tableau public weblink.  http://bit.ly/1ocwbtH
These clusters ,which based on the CH index are optimal at 4 clusters, show very distinct typed of customers.

1) "Yellow" These are the customers who shop sporadically but purchase very expensive items but infrequently. 
2) "Red" These customers spend more money per trip but still take about the same number of trips as customers in other categories.
3) "Green"  These customers spend less per trip and on cheaper items than the average customers.
4) "Blue"  Blue customer spend a typical ammount per trip and have around the same total trip spend. These customers do however take far more trips than the average customer.
